when I used to shine
shine as a daughter, sister, and a friend
oh my lord! when did this end

I used to be a prodigy
But now I feel my life is a tragedy

With every passing day
I think my parents made a mistake
the mistake of bringing me to this world
how much of a disappointment can they take

I know I am not perfect
I know I am not a star
But one day for sure
I will take myself far

Far in success and as of for now
I wish my future self all the best`

But they never realize how quickly time flies
Yesterday I was crying to play
Now at the blink of an eye,
I will soon be facing bills to pay

Dressing our barbies carefree
Climbing huge trees with glee
Oh, what sweet reminiscence it brings
I still want those wings

Believing in unicorns, Santa, and fairies
Believing in magic, where dreams never vary
Now, I'm a teenager, sitting on the couch
Filled with a world of screens and devices one can touch

I miss the days when I used to play
Now I'm stuck in a world of teens
Battling emotions I've never seen
Day and night I try to figure what life is about
But I always end with expectations and self-doubt

Peer pressure Is always in my ear,
The motive of being is never clear
No matter how old I get
A spark in my heart is set
The spark of childhood euphoria
The pure joy of a child's glee
Is the only joy I once again want to see`

Why is my friendship at it's stake

Oh God please save this light
I beg you so with all my might`

Happiness is nothing but caring less
Happiness is a weaving tale
Happiness is love but never on a scale
Happiness might be a disease
Passing from one other with ease

But If you were to dare
If you somewhat actually care
You will forced by yourself to ask
Is happiness a mask?
Does happiness exist?
Is happiness just a myth?

The Answer is quite complicated
I believe it is better to gatekeep it
Whether happiness exists or not
Always remember it has a cost
Thus another question arised
Shall happiness be compromised?
Because what if we fail to pay back?

By now happiness may seem like a mess
But you shall care less
Because even if you fail to pay back
Happiness would never be something you lack
The world is full of happiness
Happiness is helping beat the stress
The stress of anything that troubles
So let's spread happiness with our words
Let's try making happiness free
Let's try making it as simple as a glee`

I picked up the phone to place the call,
Oh! How hard my mind tried to haul

Tick-tock, the clock felt slow,
My cravings aglow, a tempting glow
Ding-dong, the doorbell rang,
My pizza order, ready to hang

Opening the box, anticipation soared high,
A cheesy delight, pleasing to the eye
But as cheese melts, my resolve's demise,
Resisting temptation, a futile guise

Though I aimed for discipline, I must confess,
In the face of pizza, I couldn't suppress
So I indulged, with guilt and pleasure combined,
A fleeting moment of weakness, in my diet confined`

It is a concept, a mindset

Popularity is that lost soul,
Lying its way in life,
Smiling through unknown crowds, 
Wearing a mask no one can remove,
Smiling through crowds, crying so loud

It feeds on fear, It drinks from doubt,
Building Thrones on shaky grounds,
And chose who chase it-lose themselves,
In echoes that never call them Home
In the end, popularity buries its own kings`

Cause I am here,

In a world full of cupid,
To be loved so stupid,

Oh to be embraced,
Through every situation one faced,
To stand together,
To be loved forever,

To be loved is it true?
To be loved, inside you
Self love is pain,
Self love is gain,

Embrace yourself,
Hold yourself,
To be loved by no one else,
To be loved themselves`

A field with only billionaire towers,
Is money the dream?
Or is it success?

The question itself is a mess,
The world needs a guiding beam,
But isn't the beam itself a dream?
A dream self-satisfied with trends,

But don't all trends have an end?
An end we'll soon reach,
What would this period teach?

A period of lies taught by power,
A period so delicate as a flower,
Teaching youth to be slaves by heart,
Gaslighting them into thinking they're smart?

Where went the period of independence?
Why do we have this fence?
A fence barricading passion,
A fence forcing attraction,

Attraction towards something unreal,
Making the rich richer,
The poor poorer,
Suffocation is what we all feel,

It's about time we leave mainstream stuff,
It's about time we break these cuffs,
It's time we realize mainstream isn't for all,
Success lies where passion falls`

They'd push, force, and establish
Mere letters ain't capital,

A lie that has been smeared in their skin,
Shredding creativity, feeding capitalism 
The world's a place no one understands,
Being forced into a system,
No questions allowed,
No justice served,

Modernism is just a hole full of bodies,
Cut, bled and unanswered,
But that's what drives humans,
Comfort,

The world's full of rats,
Brainless, 
A living system that doesn't live,
Following rules never questioned,

Chasing cheese,
Not knowing it's rotten,
Afraid to be chased by the cat,
Afraid of death one doesn't remember,

The world has ants,
Silently working under the foot,
Being killed, 
Being suppressed,

The world today doesn't realise,
It's the ant who works,
The rat who cries,
We've been pained by ones we don't know,

Nobody cares for so.`

Spinning on tunes, old school yet slick 

Camera can snap what I see,

Cause I don't need no cash,
My gold shall always be my mash,

Its Saturday night let me be free,

I saw birds paining,
My heart waiting for hues,

Of birds flying,

I creeped in,
I carried the burden within,
But then i saw a flower,
Standing still,
Blooming like a meteor shower,

It swung with the air,
Every movement embraced, 
In the atmosphere,
I could hear it calling my name,

I walked closer,
Got lost in the aura,
The garden once dead
 Now felt colorful,
My eyes admiring the beauty it fed,

My heart said to keep it dear,
Such a gift shall always be near,
But my mind hesitated,
Its not mine is it?

I saw a figure glare,

I called him teddy,
Not something unique,
But something complete,

And it was very unlikely,
For me to be attached,
Not a lot but Slightly,

Id carry it around,
I'd take him to bed,
He'd listen to me,
All while I said—

I'd share my deepest thoughts,
All the silent battles Ive fought,
With him I was never alone,
He'd take my hand,
And guide me through,
 For once I had a friend--
So true,

And came along such a noon,
I looked for him,
But I guess he left soon,
My heart filled with pain,
I had nothing left to gain,
I asked my mother,
And she replied,
"You're a teen now",
"Youre too old for a toy",

But I think she never noticed,
It was never a toy,
It was my bundle of joy,

Never once did she tell,
Where my dear teddy fell,
Years passed,
Flowers bloomed,

I wore a white dress,
And married my groom,
Then,
Along came a blessing, 

I closed my eyes,
Opened my hand,
And in there,
Lied my ray of light,

Along came my mother,
Holding something steddy,
There lied my dear teddy,

But I knew,
I aint his bestfriend,
Our friendship had ended,
It was time,
It be introduced to you,
So,
As you opened your eyes,
And let out a tear,
I placed Teddy beside you—
There's nothing to fear.

He'll be your best friend,
Like he was mine.
Through long nights and small joys,
Through the ticking of time.

Hold him close when you laugh,
When you're scared, or you cry—
He'll listen in silence,
He'll never say goodbye.

And when the time comes,
You may pass him on too—
A little thread of love,
Forever running through.`

The worlds not kind,

Let the soil cover my face,
Nothing but wheat around,
Somehow it gave me brace

The sun was my silent friend,
Painting hues of gold,
Reminding me its not the end,
Forcing me to be a better mold,

My shadow grew thin,
The sky giving me a paint brush,
Holding an opportunity,
For kindess to win,
Every stroke reminding me,
Not to rush,
The wheat danced like time,
Patient, steady and slow,
While my thoughts learned to climb,
From the valley of hatred below,

The breeze blew with grace,
Teaching me patience and will,
Helping through each turmoil faced,
My mind going still,

No answers arrived, 
No questions asked,
But somehow,
I survived,
 
My breathing slowed,
Self doubts dint vanish,
They left a trace,
But I think I gave it abode,
I think I gave it space,

I wouldn't call this field special,
I cant call this natures magic,
I'd call it self explanation,
Id rather call it tragic,

It aint fiction,
Nor dazzling relevation,
Just a silent breeze-

Not always smart,
Rarely pretty,
Shed call it a crime,

Balances books on her head;

Swims in the pool of tests,
The one who survives on coffee,
The one who wants the big trophy,
The trophy of praise,
The trophy of validation,

Creation of something new,
Creative, cool and vibrant,
When notebooks could never end,
Pens lasted for ages,
Pencils always broke,

Maybe give her hope?

little me.

so simple,

Locked away.
For i possess the sole key,
