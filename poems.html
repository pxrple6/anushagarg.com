With every passing day
I think my parents made a mistake
the mistake of bringing me to this world
how much of a disappointment can they take

I know I am not perfect

But one day for sure
I will take myself far

Far in success and as of for now

But they never realize how quickly time flies
Yesterday I was crying to play
Now at the blink of an eye,
I will soon be facing bills to pay

Dressing our barbies carefree
Climbing huge trees with glee
Oh, what sweet reminiscence it brings
I still want those wings

Believing in unicorns, Santa, and fairies
Believing in magic, where dreams never vary
Now, I'm a teenager, sitting on the couch
Filled with a world of screens and devices one can touch

I miss the days when I used to play
Now I'm stuck in a world of teens
Battling emotions I've never seen
Day and night I try to figure what life is about
But I always end with expectations and self-doubt

Peer pressure Is always in my ear,
The motive of being is never clear
No matter how old I get
A spark in my heart is set
The spark of childhood euphoria
The pure joy of a child's glee
Is the only joy I once again want to see</pre>

Happiness is nothing but caring less
Happiness is a weaving tale
Happiness is love but never on a scale
Happiness might be a disease
Passing from one other with ease

But If you were to dare
If you somewhat actually care
You will forced by yourself to ask
Is happiness a mask?
Does happiness exist?
Is happiness just a myth?

The Answer is quite complicated
I believe it is better to gatekeep it
Whether happiness exists or not
Always remember it has a cost
Thus another question arised
Shall happiness be compromised?
Because what if we fail to pay back?

By now happiness may seem like a mess
But you shall care less
Because even if you fail to pay back
Happiness would never be something you lack
The world is full of happiness
Happiness is helping beat the stress
The stress of anything that troubles
So let's spread happiness with our words
Let's try making happiness free
Let's try making it as simple as a glee</pre>

My cravings aglow, a tempting glow
Ding-dong, the doorbell rang,
My pizza order, ready to hang

Opening the box, anticipation soared high,
A cheesy delight, pleasing to the eye
But as cheese melts, my resolve's demise,
Resisting temptation, a futile guise

Though I aimed for discipline, I must confess,
In the face of pizza, I couldn't suppress
So I indulged, with guilt and pleasure combined,
A fleeting moment of weakness, in my diet confined</pre>

It is a hidden harmony of regret,
It is a concept, a mindset 
A lie that everyone belives,

Popularity is that lost soul,
Lying its way in life,
Smiling through unknown crowds, 
Wearing a mask no one can remove,
Smiling through crowds, crying so loud

It feeds on fear, It drinks from doubt,
Building Thrones on shaky grounds,
And chose who chase it-lose themselves,
In echoes that never call them Home
In the end, popularity buries its own kings</pre>

Cheer so random,

Freedom from the world,
Happiness unfurled,
A butterfly flying high,
A butterfly not so shy,

A dream so small,
But effect so tall,
Oh, a dream so pretty,
A dream that makes me pity,

Pity the reality we're in,
A pool of emotions we're swimming in,
A pool so dense yet shallow,
Surrounded by a field so fallow,

A field of success and power,
A field with only billionaire towers,
Is money the dream?
Or is it success?

The question itself is a mess,
The world needs a guiding beam,
But isn't the beam itself a dream?
A dream self-satisfied with trends,

But don't all trends have an end?
An end we'll soon reach,
What would this period teach?

A period of lies taught by power,
A period so delicate as a flower,
Teaching youth to be slaves by heart,
Gaslighting them into thinking they're smart?

Where went the period of independence?
Why do we have this fence?
A fence barricading passion,
A fence forcing attraction,

Attraction towards something unreal,
Making the rich richer,
The poor poorer,
Suffocation is what we all feel,

It's about time we leave mainstream stuff,
It's about time we break these cuffs,
It's time we realize mainstream isn't for all,
Success lies where passion falls</pre>

Every word set as the fundamental of being,
Every psychology discovered,
Every history shared,

Forcing them to drop their weapons,
To leave the battlefield,
To not craft their art,
To be in harmony,

I ask,
Is writing not enough?
They'd push, force, and establish
Mere letters ain't capital,

But that's a pile of lies,
A lie that has been smeared in their skin,
Shredding creativity, feeding capitalism 
The world's a place no one understands,
Being forced into a system,
No questions allowed,
No justice served,

Modernism is just a hole full of bodies,
Cut, bled and unanswered,
But that's what drives humans,
Comfort,

The world's full of rats,
Brainless, 
A living system that doesn't live,
Following rules never questioned,

Chasing cheese,
Not knowing it's rotten,
Afraid to be chased by the cat,
Afraid of death one doesn't remember,

The world has ants,
Silently working under the foot,
Being killed, 
Being suppressed,

The world today doesn't realise,
It's the ant who works,
The rat who cries,
We've been pained by ones we don't know,

But alas it's a modern world,
Nobody cares for so.</pre>

Spinning on tunes, old school yet slick 

Camera can snap what I see,

Layed the dead and dried,
Every leaf fallen,
the tears i cried,

I saw trees fall,
I saw birds paining,
My heart waiting for hues,
Of trees growing tall,
Of birds flying,

I creeped in,
I carried the burden within,
But then i saw a flower,
Standing still,
Blooming like a meteor shower,

It swung with the air,
Every movement embraced, 
In the atmosphere,
I could hear it calling my name,

I walked closer,
Got lost in the aura,
The garden once dead
 Now felt colorful,
My eyes admiring the beauty it fed,

My heart said to keep it dear,
Such a gift shall always be near,
But my mind hesitated,
Its not mine is it?

I waited, 
I stared,
I saw a figure glare,
Before I did,
It took my flower,
I wanted to resist,
But deep down i knew,
I wasnt the best fit.</pre>

I opened my hand,
And in there,
Lied my new bestfriend,

I called him teddy,
Not something unique,
But something complete,

And it was very unlikely,
For me to be attached,
Not a lot but Slightly,

Id carry it around,
I'd take him to bed,
He'd listen to me,
All while I said—

I'd share my deepest thoughts,
All the silent battles Ive fought,
With him I was never alone,
He'd take my hand,
And guide me through,
 For once I had a friend--
So true,

And came along such a noon,
I looked for him,
But I guess he left soon,
My heart filled with pain,
I had nothing left to gain,
I asked my mother,
And she replied,
"You're a teen now",
"Youre too old for a toy",

But I think she never noticed,
It was never a toy,
It was my bundle of joy,

Never once did she tell,
Where my dear teddy fell,
Years passed,
Flowers bloomed,

I wore a white dress,
And married my groom,
Then,
Along came a blessing, 

I closed my eyes,
Opened my hand,
And in there,
Lied my ray of light,

Along came my mother,
Holding something steddy,
There lied my dear teddy,

But I knew,
I aint his bestfriend,
Our friendship had ended,
It was time,
It be introduced to you,
So,
As you opened your eyes,
And let out a tear,
I placed Teddy beside you—
There's nothing to fear.

He'll be your best friend,
Like he was mine.
Through long nights and small joys,
Through the ticking of time.

Hold him close when you laugh,
When you're scared, or you cry—
He'll listen in silence,
He'll never say goodbye.

And when the time comes,
You may pass him on too—
A little thread of love,
Forever running through.</pre>

The winds rushed,
The wheat blew,
Above Birds hushed,
Below Flowers silently grew,

A piece of mind,
Was all I wanted,
The worlds not kind,
And the thoughts still haunted,

I sat on the ground, 
Let the soil cover my face,
Nothing but wheat around,
Somehow it gave me brace

The sun was my silent friend,
Painting hues of gold,
Reminding me its not the end,
Forcing me to be a better mold,

My shadow grew thin,
The sky giving me a paint brush,
Holding an opportunity,
For kindess to win,
Every stroke reminding me,
Not to rush,
The wheat danced like time,
Patient, steady and slow,
While my thoughts learned to climb,
From the valley of hatred below,

The breeze blew with grace,
Teaching me patience and will,
Helping through each turmoil faced,
My mind going still,

No answers arrived, 
No questions asked,
But somehow,
I survived,
 
My breathing slowed,
Self doubts dint vanish,
They left a trace,
But I think I gave it abode,
I think I gave it space,

I wouldn't call this field special,
I cant call this natures magic,
I'd call it self explanation,
Id rather call it tragic,

It aint fiction,
Nor dazzling relevation,
Just a silent breeze-

              <pre>Dear Santa Claus, 
I have a wish,
I wish the time would stop,
To change the things that cause,
In the world of lies,
Where humanity flies,

I wish I was six,
To have enough time to fix,
A person I am today,
Made up of tears and hate,

I wish I was two,
In the universes court,
Time is what ill sue,

I wish I had a time machine,
To go back and never be,
The worlds a masterpiece,
But I am not the painting it needs</pre>

              <pre>My life is a garden,
Thorns and spikes around,
Pain, sorrow, lies  beforund,
Each step shall bleed,
Each hurdle shall breed,

My garden is the place of dead,
Dead poems, dead artisary,
Look at it, I dare!
Live it in despair,

Yet, I found a flower,
Blooming and shining like a star,
Thorns and spikes had it too,
But,
Touching it gave contentment,
A mere feeling and pain,
Something sentences cant explain

It gave my life what it lacked,
Honesty, glee yet sick
Sick of fear,
Fear that I might loose the dear,
A dear not beloved,

In a world so perfect,
The flower shall never wilter,
Yet, we live in the world of gardens,
Gardens like mine,
Cultivating lies,
Feeding the temporary,
So Alas shall a new flower never grow,

To all the petals,
It shed,
To all the happiness,
It fed,
The flower shall leave its trace,
Not through the memories but scars it gave</pre>

              <pre>You hate the rain?
Asked the lillies 
But how could i explain?
Moonsoon,
The only season i glee,
When the mere roses thrive, 
When butterflies take flight,
The atmosphere,
Wearing  the fragrance of dirt,
Comforting to most,
Annoying to those lost,
Lost in the essence of emotions,
Reminiscing about the commotions,
 Rain,
Something harmless yet powerful,
Being the supreme saboteur, 
Destroying homes, famillies 
Erasing those as if never before, 
Deluge, 
The harbinger of sorrow in someones life,
Being the electricity,
That makes hurdles thrive,
It eats-it never spares,
It doesnt see money, 
It doesnt see stares,
What can i say?
The worlds a garden,
I shall be the sunflower, 
What most adore,
I avoid the rain,
The season of love,
The season of pain,
The thief of joy,
Yet, the god of love 
The rain is complicated,
So is life,
To the Lillies,
I offer only silence</pre>

every fold singing its own song,
Vibrant colours treasure history,
While art takes different forms,

Suits, Kurtas and Saris
History leaves no glory,
Every day brings a new trend,
Those left behind?
Left in the attic of reminiscence

Festivals welcome new clothes,
dancing to the rhythm of past,
each stich finds its place,
showing evocating crafts,

Turbans and Dupattas,
We flaunt them with pride,
every look carries a soul,
every accessory showing poise,
Tradition drapes our being,
in patterns time can't erase,
A legacy stitched with passion,
in every thread — a sacred grace.

From loom to life it lingers,
echoing roots we hold dear,
Traditional outfits — more than attire,
they're heritage we wear near.</pre>
